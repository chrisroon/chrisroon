### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Chris Rooney. I have spent the last 3 and a half years studying computer science at the Univeristy of St. Thomas. Prior to attending college, I didn't really know what I wanted to do. Three and a half years later I still don't, but I have learned a lot along the way. One thing I learned about college was that you aren't there to learn facts, you are there to learn how to think. Many assignments seem pointless, and something you will never use again. While you might not use those specific lines of code, the problem-solving, teamwork, and fundemental concepts stick with you and are useful later. 

When I took a web development course, I felt unmotivated because I thought that what we were learning wasn't anything like what I would do at a job as a web developer. I was somewhat right but mostly wrong. The point wasn't to remember specific lines of javascript, the goal was to learn how to solve problems related to web development, and to understand how web applications on a basic level. 
Here is one assignment we did, creating a personal website using only the Foundation 6 CSS framework and HTML/CSS: [Personal Website](https://github.com/chrisroon/chrisroon.github.io)
Some things from this project that would help me later on in my internship was the basic understanding of web development including making apps responsive. This has been something I have had to work on a lot at my current job as an app developer.

Another project I did in web development was creating a St. Paul Crime mapper. This project was much more complex than the other ones and required much more time, effort, and teamwork. This project is connected to St. Thomas' mission for the common good. It is a project which increases awareness of crimes happening in different neighborhoods around St. Paul. I learned a lot from this project from my teammates as well as professor.
