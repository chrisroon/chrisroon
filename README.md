### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Chris Rooney. I have spent the last 3 and a half years studying computer science at the Univeristy of St. Thomas. Prior to attending college, I didn't really know what I wanted to do. Three and a half years later I still don't, but I have learned a lot along the way. One thing I learned about college was that you aren't there to learn facts, you are there to learn how to think. Many assignments seem pointless, and something you will never use again. While you might not use those specific lines of code, the problem-solving, teamwork, and fundemental concepts stick with you and are useful later. 

Personal Website
When I took a web development course, I felt unmotivated because I thought that what we were learning wasn't anything like what I would do at a job as a web developer. I was somewhat right but mostly wrong. The point wasn't to remember specific lines of javascript, the goal was to learn how to solve problems related to web development, and to understand how web applications on a basic level. 
Here is one assignment we did, creating a personal website using only the Foundation 6 CSS framework and HTML/CSS: [Personal Website](https://github.com/chrisroon/chrisroon.github.io)
Some things from this project that would help me later on in my internship was the basic understanding of web development including making apps responsive. This has been something I have had to work on a lot at my current job as an app developer.

Dynamic Web Server
Another project I did in web development was creating a dynamic web server. This project was much more complex than the last one and required much more time, effort, and teamwork. I learned many useful skill in relation to manipulating and representing data. I also enhanced my skills in writing javascript in this prpoject. This project is connected to St. Thomas' mission for the common good. The web server allows the user to view graphical representations of sea level data with various filters. This is important for the common good given the sea level's relation to climate change.

The skills I learned from this project also have turned out to be useful at my job as an app developer today. Learning how to manipulate data and apply filters has been a common task of mine.

Alcohol Consumption Data Analysis
In my data mining and machine learning class, we learned several different technicques for analyzing different types of data. This knowledge and skills I have learned from this class are very relevant to today's society given the rapid growth of AI use. The final project I did in this class was investigating different predictors of alochol consumption in students. Our society's relationship is very unhealthy, so this type of exploration is very important for furthering the common good. Understanding what types of behaviors are related to underage alcohol consumption is crucial for mitigating risk and promoting healthy behavior.
